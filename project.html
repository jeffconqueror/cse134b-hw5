                    description="Developing a fully automated pipeline that takes a text prompt and produces an animated, segmented, and simulation-ready 3D asset in game engine. Most text-to-3D models generate a single, monolithic mesh, which has the right shape, but no functional parts. We aim to bridge this Usability gap by creating a system that automatically makes these static meshes usable, and also fix the time-consuming problem of manually animating characters and setting up their interactions in game engine."

                    alt="Before and after comparison showing dramatic improvement in low-light cathedral photography"
                    description="In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset."

We propose a hierarchical memory system that segments videos into action and scene units, combined with question-aware agentic keyframe selection. Our method achieves 70.3% overall accuracy on VideoMME short video benchmarks."

                    description="We propose TG-NAS, a universal, model-based zero-cost (ZC) proxy that combines a Transformer-based operator embedding generator with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict architecture performance. Unlike prior model-based predictors, TG-NAS requires no retraining and generalizes across arbitrary search spaces. It serves as a standalone ZC proxy with strong data efficiency, robustness, and cross-space consistency. Extensive evaluations across diverse NAS benchmarks demonstrate TG-NAS's superior rank correlation and generalizability compared to existing proxies. Additionally, it improves search efficiency by up to 300x and discovers architectures achieving 93.75% CIFAR-10 accuracy on NAS-Bench-201 and 74.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy on the DARTS space, establishing TG-NAS as a promising foundation for efficient, generalizable NAS."
